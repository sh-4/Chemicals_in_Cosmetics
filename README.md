# Chemicals in Cosmetics

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to take a look at the data (up to 2020) from cosmetic companies who use chemicals within their products. This can help inform potential customers of what chemicals are in these cosmetics, and which brands take preference to this method of producing products. A future analysis of clean products could be a helpful tool to those who wish to cut out chemicals from their regime.

## Summary


## Limitations

- This dataset only includes information reported to California Department of Public Health (CDPH), which means this is not an all-inclusive list of cosmetic companies and the chemicals they put into their products
- There are some discrepancies within the data, such as products being listed as discontinued on a date earlier than the date reported to the CDPH. This could mean that the product was reported for informative purposes only, however, it is unclear from the dataset itself
- The reasoning behind each discontinued item is unknown from this dataset, so it is unclear whether the chemical formulation was the determining factor, or if the products were discontinued for another reason
